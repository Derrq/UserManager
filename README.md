# UserManager
A React/Redux/Python app built to use Python-tornado's RESTful API to perform CRUD operations to manage users.


**To Run Back end:**
- cd userApp-backend
- py app.py

**To Run Front-end:**
- cd userApp-frontend/user-app
- npm start

This runs the app in the development mode. 
**NOTE:** 
Since the back-end would run on port 3000 then you would have to run the front-end on a different port so on the prompt self y/yes and Open http://localhost:3001 to view it in your browser.

The backup.sql file with the database schema can be found in the userApp-backend directory.

Working application would look like this on your browser:
